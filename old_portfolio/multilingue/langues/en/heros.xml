	<description>&lt;p&gt;Heroes are the essential element of Dota 2, as the course of the game is dependent on their intervention. Players are split into two teams of 5, and can select a hero from a selection panel. All heroes have different play styles that stem from unique abilities and combinations of attributes. Over the course of the game, heroes will accumulate experience. Once a hero has enough experience, they level up, making them more powerful than before and allowing them to level up new abilities. Most heroes have a distinct role that defines how they can affect the battlefield, though many heroes can perform two or more of these Roles.
Currently, 111 of the 112 heroes are playable in the main Dota 2 client. For a table of heroes sorted by attributes and mechanics, see Table of Hero attributes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
